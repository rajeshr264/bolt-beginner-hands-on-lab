# Deploying an application with a plan
In this exercise you will further explore Puppet Plans by writing a multi-stage plan to deploy a sample application.

The sample application for this lesson consists of four nodes. It has a single database node, two application servers, and a single load balancer in front of them.  

This is an advanced lesson. You will need to use a [different lab environment](https://github.com/puppetlabs/tasks-hands-on-lab/tree/master/10-deploying-an-application).
